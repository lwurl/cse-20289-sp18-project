Errata

Summary of things that don't work (quite right).
The website is working correctly online. We are not able to pass three
of the tests in test_spidey. While we were never able to quite figure out
what we were missing in handle errors part of the tests, we were able to
handle the Brose Requests until recently when we got the Cowsay to work on
the internet again.

Contributions
-------------

Enumeration of the contributions of each group member.

Sam, Luke, and James all each worked on pieces individually prior to sharing
the with the group. Each person took between 2 and three of the files to try
on their own, and then everyone worked on debugging together. We hooked up external
monitors to Luke's computer so we could all see and interact with the code.
